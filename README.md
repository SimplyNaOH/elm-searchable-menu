# Elm Searchable Menu

After watching watching the video [elm-autocomplete with Greg Ziegan (API Design Session)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSuCYUqY058) I was inspired  to take part of a web app I was working on and separate it on a reusable component.

## Disclaimer

**elm-searchable-menu** is my first component, within my first Elm project, and as of this writing it's in a very rudimentary stage. I *strongly* recommend you to check [elm-autocomplete][elm-autocomplete] before even considering using this library.

## Demo

You can check the kind of menu you can make with this library in this [demo](https://SimplyNaOH.github.io/elm-searchable-menu).

## Acknowledgment

Some parts of the API code was either directly copied or ported from [elm-autocomplete][elm-autocomplete], so credit goes to [thebritican](https://github.com/thebritican).
